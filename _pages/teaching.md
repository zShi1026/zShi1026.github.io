During the 2023â€“2024 academic year, I served as a paraprofessional (teaching assistant) in the Department of Geology at Colorado College. My primary responsibilities included assisting students during lab sessions, managing field trip logistics, and grading tests and homework.


Here is a list of courses that I assisted:

| Course Title                           |
|----------------------------------------|
| Intro to Earth Systems                 |
| Investigate Earth as a Physical System |
| Surface Processes and Geomorphology    |
